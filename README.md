# Desire Bot
Last updated: January 31, 2015

## Description
Twitter bot that reposts tweets that begin with "I just want..." 

Tweets containing @usernames, #hashtags, or URLs are rejected. Words from the original tweet are broken down, and sent to Wordnik for analysis. Words identified as nouns are kept, and used as a Flickr search string. Any Flickr image that has tags matching all keywords are kept.
